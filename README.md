# GitHub User Search

I've developed this project on Eduzz`s Bootcamp by DIO, our instrutctor was Matheus Benites.
I've made some changes, especialy on the apparence and also add some features such as search by hiting the "enter" key (the buttom also works)
I think it have some space to improve, like a suggestion of last researches, for instance.
